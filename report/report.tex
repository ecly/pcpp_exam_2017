Through all tests, the same machine will be used. Below are the results of \texttt{SystemInfo}:

\section{Question 1}
\subsection{}
Seeing as we are interested in seeing how well each implementation performs on random input of different sizes, we use Mark9 for the benchmarking, as it calculates the per element mean time and standard deviation.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \noindent\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{res/graph_q1.png}
    \caption{Plot of running times of given implementations. Tested with size = 10000000.}
    \label{fig:graphq1}
\end{figure}

From graph \ref{fig:graphq1} we see that, perhaps unsurprisingly, the serial quickselect and quickcount implementations beat out serial sort entirely.
We do however see parallel sort get rather close to the expected linear running time implementations, due to the test machine having a quad-core CPU,
allowing an approximate 4 time speedup from the serial implementation. Between the expected linear running time algorithms, it seems serial quickselect 
beat out its quickcount counterparts, however the difference is so small that we have yet to find a definitive winner.
